# Theory of Automata - FAST-NUCES Lahore

The **Theory of Automata** course at FAST-NUCES Lahore is a core part of the computer science curriculum. It explores abstract machines and the mathematical models of computation, focusing on automata such as finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines. 

Students learn key topics including:
- Finite State Machines (FSM)
- Regular languages and expressions
- Context-free grammars
- Deterministic and non-deterministic automata
- Decidability and computational complexity

This course equips students with the theoretical knowledge required to understand the limits of computation and apply automata theory in various domains such as language processing, compiler design, and algorithm development.
